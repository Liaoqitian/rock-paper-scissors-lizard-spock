## Background
This extended version of "Rock Paper Scissors" is first introduced in Season 2 Episode 8, "The lizard-Spock Expansion". 
When Sheldon and Raj can't agree about what to watch on TV, Raj suggests they settle it with a game of Rock Paper Scissors. Sheldon thinks they should play Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock instead, as there is a lower chance that the game will end in a tie.
