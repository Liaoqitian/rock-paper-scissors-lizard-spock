# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

This project is created in tribute to the great TV series "The Big Bang Series". This extended version of "Rock Paper Scissors" is first introduced in Season 2 Episode 8, "The lizard-Spock Expansion". When Sheldon and Raj can't agree about what to watch on TV, Raj suggests they settle it with a game of Rock Paper Scissors. Sheldon thinks they should play Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock instead, as there is a lower chance that the game will end in a tie.
